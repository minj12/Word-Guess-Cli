# Word-Guess-Cli

A word game created in Node-js, uses two different constructors that are index.js and word.js.  The index.js is what has the game work using a terminal that runs node. "index.js" and word.js  is dependent on the constructor.  In the game the user is prompted to enter a letter to try to guess the word, which starts with blanks.  If the letter is in the word, the word/underscore representation is shown with the letter revealed.  If the letter is not in the word, the user is told "Sorry..." and given another chance to guess, with a total of 8 wrong guesses possible. If the user use up their 8 guesses, they lose the game.
